# Gradient-Boosting-from-Scratch
This notebook focuses on predicting individual medical costs using regression models, specifically, gradient boosting. The key highlight of this project is the development of a gradient boosting regressor from scratch, followed by a performance comparison with Scikit-learn's GradientBoostingRegressor.
